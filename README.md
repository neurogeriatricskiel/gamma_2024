# GAMMA Workshop â€“ Kiel 2024
Welcome to the **GAMMA 2024 Workshop on Python Programming for Movement Sciences**. This repository provides the materials and guidance for participants to get hands-on experience with Python programming for movement data analysis.

## Python for Movement Sciences

In this workshop, we will cover essential programming concepts tailored to analyzing movement data using Python. The workshop is designed to be beginner-friendly and will guide you through setting up the environment and running your first analyses.

### Before Getting Started

To follow along with this workshop, you'll need access to Google Colab. Below are the steps to get you set up and ready for the exercises:

### Access Google Colab

1. **Sign in to Google Colab**  
   Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account. If you don't have an account, you can create one for free.
   
2. **Create a New Notebook**  
   Once signed in, click on "File" in the top-left corner and select "Open notebook."

3. **Open the GitHub Tab**  
   In the dialog, select the **GitHub** tab and paste the following repository URL:  
   `https://github.com/neurogeriatricskiel/gamma_2024`

4. **Open the Notebook**  
   In the repository, find the notebook named `gamma_ws3_python_programming.ipynb` and open it. This notebook contains the core exercises and instructions for the workshop.

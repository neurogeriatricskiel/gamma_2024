# GAMMA Workshop – Kiel 2024
Welcome to the **GAMMA 2024 Workshop on Python Programming for Movement Sciences**. This repository provides the materials and guidance for participants to get hands-on experience with Python programming for movement data analysis.

## Python for Movement Sciences

In this workshop, we will cover essential programming concepts tailored to analyzing movement data using Python. The workshop is designed to be beginner-friendly and will guide you through setting up the environment and running your first analyses.

### Before Getting Started

To follow along with this workshop, you'll need access to Google Colab. Below are the steps to get you set up and ready for the exercises:

### Access Google Colab

1. **Sign in to Google Colab**  
   Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account. If you don't have an account, you can create one for free.
   
2. **Create a New Notebook**  
   Once signed in, click on "File" in the top-left corner and select "Open notebook."

3. **Open the GitHub Tab**  
   In the dialog, select the **GitHub** tab and paste the following repository URL:  
   `https://github.com/neurogeriatricskiel/gamma_2024`

4. **Open the Notebook**  
   In the repository, find the notebook named `gamma_ws3_python_programming.ipynb` and open it. This notebook contains the core exercises and instructions for the workshop.

## Running Jupyter Notebooks Locally

For those who prefer to run the notebooks on their local machines, here are the steps:

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**  
   To run the notebooks locally, you need to have the repository files on your machine. You can either:
   - **Download the repository**: Click on the "Code" button at the top of the repository page and select "Download ZIP." Extract the ZIP file to your desired location.
   - **Clone the repository**: If you have Git installed, run the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/neurogeriatricskiel/gamma_2024.git
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Notebooks Folder**  
   Once the repository is downloaded or cloned, open your terminal (on macOS or Linux) or command prompt (on Windows) to navigate to the specific folder that contains the workshop notebooks. Here’s how to do it step by step:

   #### For Windows Users

   1. **Open Command Prompt**:  
      - Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
      - Type `cmd` and press `Enter`. This opens the Command Prompt.

   2. **Change Directory to the Repository**:  
      - If you downloaded the ZIP file, you need to locate the path to where you extracted the files. For example, if you extracted it to `C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads\gamma_2024`, you would type:
        ```bash
        cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads\gamma_2024\notebooks
        ```
      - If you cloned the repository using Git, you will also have it in your chosen directory. For example:
        ```bash
        cd C:\path\to\your\gamma_2024\notebooks
        ```

   #### For macOS and Linux Users

   1. **Open Terminal**:  
      - You can find Terminal in Applications > Utilities, or you can search for it using Spotlight (press `Cmd + Space` and type "Terminal").

   2. **Change Directory to the Repository**:  
      - Similar to Windows, you need to know where the repository is located on your system. If you downloaded the ZIP file to your `Downloads` folder, type:
        ```bash
        cd ~/Downloads/gamma_2024/notebooks
        ```
      - If you cloned the repository, navigate to the path you specified during cloning, for example:
        ```bash
        cd ~/path/to/your/gamma_2024/notebooks
        ```

3. **Install Jupyter Notebook**  
   To run the notebooks locally, ensure that you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install Jupyter by running:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**  
   Once Jupyter Notebook is installed, start the Jupyter Notebook server by running:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Open the Workshop Notebook**  
   In your web browser, Jupyter Notebook will open automatically. Navigate to `gamma_ws3_python_programming.ipynb` and you can begin working with it.
